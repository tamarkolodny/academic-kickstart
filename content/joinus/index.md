We are looking for curious and motivated students and postdocs from diverse backgrounds, 
who are interesting in natural language processing.
If you are looking for a postdoc, Ph.D., Masters, undergrad project or summer internship,
please <a href="mailto:roys@allenai.org">email Roy</a>, 
attach a 2-page CV, and briefly describe your research interests. 
Note that Roy is currently still in Seattle, but he is happy to chat with prospective students and potentially start remote collaboration.
