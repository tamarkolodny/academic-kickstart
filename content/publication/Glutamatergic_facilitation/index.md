abstract: "There is large individual variability in human neural responses and perceptual abilities. The factors that give rise to these individual differences, however, remain largely unknown. To examine these factors, we measured fMRI responses to moving gratings in the motion-selective region MT, and perceptual duration thresholds for motion direction discrimination. Further, we acquired MR spectroscopy data, which allowed us to quantify an index of neurotransmitter levels in the region of area MT. These three measurements were conducted in separate experimental sessions within the same group of male and female subjects. We show that stronger Glx (glutamate + glutamine) signals in the MT region are associated with both higher fMRI responses and superior psychophysical task performance. Our results suggest that greater baseline levels of glutamate within MT facilitate motion perception by increasing neural responses in this region."
