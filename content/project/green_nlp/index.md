title: Green NLP
summary: <div style='text-align:justify'>The computations required for deep learning research have been doubling every few months. These computations have a surprisingly large carbon footprint. Moreover, the financial cost of the computations can make it difficult for academics, students, and researchers, in particular those from emerging economies, to engage in deep learning research. Our lab studies tools to make NLP technology more <b>efficient</b>, and to enhance the reporting of computational budgets.</div>
